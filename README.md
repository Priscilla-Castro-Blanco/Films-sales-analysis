# SQL Project: DVD Rental Data Analysis

This project showcases my ability to perform data analysis using SQL, focusing on a DVD rental database that simulates the business processes of a rental store. The goal of this project is to provide insightful analysis that can support decision-making in a business environment.

### Project Overview
In this project, I worked with a comprehensive dataset from a DVD rental store, which includes information about customers, rentals, payments, inventory, and films. By posing a series of business-relevant questions, I used SQL queries to uncover trends, insights, and key performance indicators (KPIs) to assist in optimizing operations and improving customer satisfaction.

### Key Objectives
- **Data Exploration:** Examined and explored the database schema, understanding the relationships between tables and the flow of data through the business.
- **Business Queries:** Formulated and executed SQL queries to answer specific business questions such as:
  - What are the available movies in specific time frames and other specifications?
  - Research specific customers through the database.
  - What are the countries where the Video Rental company is present?
  - What are the total sales by country?
- **Data Aggregation:** Utilized SQL aggregation functions to generate summaries of customer behavior, film popularity, and revenue streams.
- **Optimization Recommendations:** Based on the data analysis, I provided actionable recommendations, such as adjusting inventory based on rental trends or targeting high-value customers for loyalty programs.
